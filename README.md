# PROJECT-MINI-UPS

The goal of the project was to manufacture a marketable product using electronics, with new
features to meet an existing need. It was decided to manufacture a new Mini UPS which comes
with quick charging USB port, short circuit protection, power switching system as well as a battery
voltage level indicator in addition to the 12V,9V /2A rated outputs. A marketing plan also was
carried out parallel to the designing and production procedure and a marketing survey was
conducted in order to get the ideas of the customers. Quick charging port is a result of that survey.
As it was also needed to market the newly manufactured product, several marketing strategies
were planned to be put into action in order to market the product. The product was planned to be
introduced to the market under a new company name created by myself. All the aspects such as
getting necessary components, designing PCBs, manufacturing enclosures and packaging, which
are connected to mass scale manufacture were taken into consider and ways of achieving them
were well planned.

Here is the outlook of the prototype
